Used AI for debugging + help with creating enemy path finding and minimap.  


What's Awesome:  
Minimap added that shows enemy, target, maze, and myself in real-time.  
Implemented enemy pathfinding to my red enemy cube.  
Wall collision so no going through walls.  
Activate fly mode/no fly mode using 'F' key.  
Full screen mode (small addition, but extra).
